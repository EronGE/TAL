	<h1> The World of Miristeer</h1>

	<p>Welcome to Miristeer, the first world I ever built. This was the first setting I ever established and what started my addiction to tabletop RPGs. Miristeer was my first step into the rabbit hole I now find myself trapped in and I dont regret any part of it. Well maybe a little bit but I enjoy my sleepless nights none the less.</p>

	<img src="Miristeer upscale.PNG" alt="Miristeer upscale">

	<p>A world where the Gods watch over from their respective realms as darker powers make pacts with mortals. A world where the dying empire of Salazar has been the center of five world wars both as an aggressor and a defender. This world was baptized in a war among the gods and the blood it spilled was used to write every chapter of war that came next. From the coldest points in The Grey Lands to the hottest pits of hell in the jungles of Mazdamund, there will be conflict but there will also be kindness. The people of the lands still smile with hearts warm even in their past blood shed, and maybe with new gods formed from the 6th and last war of light maybe the pain shall finally end.</p>

	<p>The Grey lands:<br> 
	The Grey lands were once a land uncharted and unknown, a cold and icy land where your wit is all you have. Once thought to be uninhabited, when the Quanian empire and the republic of Malburn brought colonists to the uncharted lands, they were met with mass hostility by the local tribe's men of the north. This lead to the colonization war for the north, bringing many of the Grey landers into slavery. However it was the efforts of a group of heroes from the main empires; Quan, Salazar, Alvenros, and the Glade along side an outlander from the Grey Lands who rode the legendary Tarrasque that lead to a mass revolution against the empires of the old world. Post conflict the North became a hub for industry and invention, as new methods of warfare and philosophy were born from their harth lit halls.  </p>

	<p>The Quan Empire:<br>
	An empire that was created as the tribes of the mountains, the coasts and of the planes united together as one force when the Salazarians ventured north to expand their empire. The Quanians were originally people who lived simple lives as nomadic hunters, fishermen, mountain dwelling monks and prairie riders. They were all at odds with each other </p>

	<p>Malos:<br> 
	A country of mainly dwarves, they live in the mountains where they produce mechanical marvels to the world. Malos and Quan have a solid alliance with eachother and has lead to Quan arming themselves with advanced gunpowder based weaponry and explosives. The dwarves found much prosperity from their former God, Dormanu father of the forge, however after the 6th war of light the new Goddess Kyoka the Forge Mother provides just as much prosperity to these halls of fire and flames.</p>

	<p>The Salazar Empire:<br> 
	The Salazarian Empire is the dying man of Miristeer, it was once a powerful country with rich culture and military prowes however as the sands of time wore down the empire they grew into stagnation. Unwilling to adapt and evolve, the other countries around them began to develop new technology out classing them ten fold. Why the empire hasnt been swallowed up by its neighbours of Alvenros or Quan is a mystery to many. </p>

	<p>Mench:<br> 
	A simple country, run by the most terrifying naval force in the north. Mench is a country that was made through the blood of thousands who fought for their independence against Malburn, the was was seen as justified by the global stage due to how Malburn forcibly brought mench under their control when their liberation from Salazar ended. With the end of their waring period mench has come outwith one of the most capable insurgent armies on the planet, the M.I.R.A: Mench Independence Revolutionary Army.</p>

	<p>The Republic of Malburn:<br>
	A republic of people that were created when they rebeled against the rule of the Salazarian empire, they were once united with Mench under a monarchy but after the Mench revolution the kingdom of Malburn became a constitutional republic. Being lead by a council of senators with a primeminister as a main face the republic of malburn operates with their royal family as a figure head similar to that of our real world Britain. </p>

	<p>Alvenros:<br> 
	A military state with one of the strongest standing militaries on the planet, they've constantly pushed forward to annex and conquer portions of Salazar and the Glade. They are lead by a single leader noted to be a president, however the way they are described as they sounds more like a dictator. This country has found massive prosperity from the military industry and special resources, such as solid magical crystals that radiate intense magical energy. </p>

	<p>The Glades:<br> 
	A untamed and dangerous land, where the plants can easily kill you as quickly as the people could should you cross them. Unlike the Grey Lands the Glade has taken the technology of the would outside of them and made them to fit their needs, though the Gladers still live in tribe communities and small villages they've been seen using high powered combat rifles and motorized engines in their boats. The landscape of the Glade comprise of beautiful rolling hills and temperate forests, and is the bigest country on the map, however size does not always mean effectivness. </p>

	<p>Talmarud:<br>
	The Island nation of talmarud, said to be the final resting place of the Dark God Tilresith and his jailors are his very children the Tieflings. They however live a happy life, even if 99% of their landmass wants to kill them, they've found an easy way to live their lives as time has went on. It's also rumoured that the mythical dragon is not only alive but thriving in these lands its even rumoured that dragon riders are a part of their fielded military.</p>

	<p>Nerub:<br> 
	A land of Sand and climate so hot you could cook an egg wthout cracking the shell. Nerub was once a very cold place but after the magics of the ancient vampire dynasties went awry the land became a desert inhabited by dangerous animals and very little places to cultivate plants. This has lead to them forming small city state kingdoms based around who controls the water and who doesn't.</p>

	<p>The Misty Isles:<br>
	once known as the Bright Isles, they were inhabited by mainly elves and men. However when the Vampire dynasties of Nerub left for a new home they found the Bright Isles to plant their unholy flag, the original inhabitants of the Bright Isles were killed and turned into ghouls and the Misty Isles became what it is now. However since the end of the 6th war of light things have changed, its been said the vampire cults have been culled and a new vampire lord has been instiled, raising their banner on the old capital of the Bright Isles and waving the colours of the past country; their name is only said in hushed whispers, but they all whisper the same name: "The Crimson King"  </p>

	<p>Tardonis:<br> 
	The Pirate capital of the world, once an uninhabbited island now the perfect place to set up a "Merchant republic" run by privateetrs. Well thats what the locals tend to call it, but everyone in the south knows better than to trust those words.</p>

	<p>Mazdamund:<br>
	A land of dangerous jungles and lizard people, Mazdamund has layed mostly untouched and unexplored. </p>

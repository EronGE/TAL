	<h1>The Milky way Galaxy: <br>The Chimera Police</br></h1>
	<p>The Milky Way was turned on its head when FTL space travel revealed humans were not alone and that there were more space faring races in the astral seas. In the shadow of the Calamity war, a conflict between the empires that lasted 20 years, the new galactic senate aims to heal the wounds of the past.</p>

	<h1>Chimera Squad A-1</h1>
	<p>The Chimera program, a program made by the senate to prove that the wounds of the past can be healed through co-operation, by putting different races together in operational squades and proving that the divisions of the past are just that, the past. Will Squad A-1 manage to stop the terrorist organization of Revenant from burning this city to the ground? or will Revenant and its elements prove that unity is never possible. Squad A1 comprises of the following misfits:</p>

	<ol>
	<ul>
		<li>Capt Dylan Everest: Unity Captain</li>

		<p>Drow Elf veteran of the Calamity war, she was specially selected to lead this anti-terror unit due to her leadership skills in the calamity war. However this capt only sees her achivments in the war as a symbol of her sins.</p>

		<li>Gormac: Investegation and Muscle</li>

		<p>A human turned Teifling due to an incident with his work in the Earth Special Technology Investegation unity. He's warry about his new form and probably going to vomit from the amount of nerves he has but when it comes to aether technology he's the lead man. Gormac has also found his place as a key member to the scientific community in the city, as old co-workers of his have found themselves in city-66 as well.</p>

		<li>Aerys: Medical Specialist and Rig Pilot</li> 

		<p>A halfling veteran of the calamity war, she's the team's main Rig pilot and medical specialist. Coming from the Children of the Underground she's no stranger to rough and tumble situations, much needed experience for her new line of work taking down elements in the city set on spreading chaos.</p>

		<li>Maves: Team Markswomen and Senator's Daughter</li>

		<p>The daughter to an elf senator, seeing someone of her social standing here is a surprise, however a welcome one still. Chimera is set on bringing all into the fold and with her diplomatic understanding she serves as a key part in securing funding and deals. </p>

		<li>Thrall Stone-Smaka: Archavist and Tired Unpaid Intern</li> 

		<p>A new face to the force, Thrall is an orc with a very obscured past. All thats solidly known is that he's enrolled in the training achademy and is here for on-sight experiance and that he's got minor contacts around the city. Smaller and lankier than most orks Thrall seems to let it get to him at times.</p>

		<li>Paxilius Ozwind: Equipment Specialist and Resident Addict</li>

		<p>A strange kobolt indeed, Paxilius or "Pax" as he's also known as, is the team's lead engineer and equipment specialist. he is basically a one man engineering, maintenance, and fabrication team; this being a literal statment, seeing as how Pax has a strange ability to split himself as if experiencing mitosis and making a perfect copy of himself by doing so.</p>

		<li>Stg Francis Jackson: Phsychologist and Physical Trainer</li>

		<p>Once part of the United Nations Earth Conglomerate's orbital drop marines Stg Francis Jackson was a soldier of the calamity war. After his term ended he saw dozens of his fellow soldiers suffering from PTSD and addiction, he saw it was up to him to help them. Using the funds provided to him by the army after his service, he entered the psychology and kinesiology fields to make sure he didn't have to watch one of his siblings' in arms suffer in silence.</p>

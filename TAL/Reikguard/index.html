		<h1>The Land of Reikguard</h1>

		<p>Reikguard is a new setting I've been working on, lore wise it's still being finished up but I have a good amount of it ready. I made this setting with a political campaign in mind, along with using the homebrewed mass-combat rules for Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition. This setting is yet to run but I'm extremely excited for when it runs.</p>

		<img src="Reikguard (world map).jpg" alt="Reikguard (world map)">

		<p>Reikguard is an empire that has stood for two centuries now, slowly building its borders by starting in the kingdom of Talmerius and uniting with its neighbouring kingdoms via diplomatic marriage or military intervention. It has survived invasions from the east by orc and yuan-ti tribes and foreign nations attempting to destabilize the peace from the inside. However what could bring this glorious empire to its knees is not a great enemy or an act of the gods, but a sick emperor with no successor named, and the very bureaucracy that helped the empire to run.</p> 

		<p>The other kingdoms of the empire are not without their own troubles however. Galiath, the kingdom south of the imperial capital of Autograd, has felt a shift in the spirits of the land. It is as if the ancestors they worship are angered by something within the spirit realm or maybe they warn of a great danger to come with their omens of dark skies and dead Elks.</p> 

		<p>To the west of the capital we see the naval powerhouse of the empire, Yaldorf. A kingdom built on the might of the waves, fielding the greatest navy known to the world Yaldorf stands as an impregnable wall against the sea. However, within  the Yaldorf Oceanic Guard the Admirals fight amongst themselves in an attempt to gain the most prestige and glory.</p>

		<p>The eastern border of the empire is the impenetrable fortress kingdom of Falcan. Known as the gateway to the wastes this kingdom has learned what it means to be a militarized nation, fielding the strongest armies of the empire. Each soldier is equipped with the latest military technology, experimental black powder weaponry for both the common foot soldier and their siege weapons. However a country no matter how hardened finds their match one day, and with rumours of the Yuan-Ti once again amassing under a new Khan they may well find it sooner than they would like to think.</p>

		<p>North of Falcan is the breadbasket of the empire, Petrov. This kingdom has served as the main producer of grain for the rest of the empire, feeding millions. They were brought into the empire through force along with their neighbour Northwick, however Petrov capitulated and founds its place in the empire rather quickly. A land so peaceful would seem unlikely to have its worries however grain is a very fickle thing, it bruns and rots very quickly. Along with that when baked in a tampered state, it could be more than enough to leave millions sick. </p>

		<p>Within the mountains of the imperial north lies the fittingly named kingdom of North Wind. This is a land of unforgiving ice and snow, with mountains so high they ascend the clouds and valleys so low you would think they reached the pits of hell. However they still stand as the most formidable border kingdom next to Falcan, with their natural borders and climate protecting them. Enemies of the kingdom still exist however, with their queen naming an outsider Yuan-ti as her heir, Dutches Elizaveta Rofiel paints a large target on her back and the back of her daughter. </p>

		<p>In the north coast of the Leviathan Gulf is the bank of the empire, the goblin kingdom of Conchiglie. A place where commerce is king, and the only philosophy that they follow is the mighty imperial dollar. However their people have no love for greed, instead they see charity as their true calling. There are still those who see this small kingdom as a plump target, and many more who have debts they rather not pay to the Dragon bank.</p>

		<p>Continuing west is the ally of North Wind, Svinheim. United due to marriage, Svinheim provides all the metal and gems needed by the empire, however North Wind always gets first pick from their hauls. Svinheim lives a happy and simple life of mining and artician craft, but still find themselves in the hot seat due to their stratigic positioning between the east and the west. </p>

		<p>Reaching the western border is the kingdom of Zau'Min, a recent addition to the empire only being brought into the empire two years ago. They serve as a jumping off point for the empire to move west, however their greed for expansion may be what undoes them. There are whispers in the scholarly courts of Zau'Min that a revolution is brewing, that the people of the grass lands will not let easterners force their culture into the enlightened imperial halls.</p>

		<p>Fardenland is the cultural hub of the empire, birthing the most artists, composers, architects and performers out of any kingdom. They face very little threats due to their position near the western mountain range, thus why they've found relative peace in their opra halls. With all this peace and enlightenment, no one notices the quiet forces readying to over throw their imperial rule.</p>

		<p>To finish out roundbout of the empire is Castelia, the rival to Yaldorf in the naval power arms race. While Yaldorf concerns itself with military matters, Castelia looks to merchant fleets and the weakness of many: alcohol. Their cellars are filled with wine and mead like none has ever seen before, but is alcohol really the only thing within the cellars of this kingdom?</p>

		<p>The last country is the only country to ever fend off the empire to the point where the empire didnt want to fight for it anymore. Leviathan's Reef and the Kraken Back Flats serve as a land of defiance and chaos, a foil to the Empire's order and law. The best way to describe this land is in their motto and saying. a land of "No Kings or Queens" where the law is "whatever the hell we want"</p>

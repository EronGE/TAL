	<p>okay so a change from the usual here, I just really wanted to make a joke with this encounter and made Bell Delphine a fae entity that hypnotized people using spring water...okay I was really drunk when writting it and well the players loved it. Who am I to stop a good laugh, I'm a story teller and if its fun for them then its fun for me. </p>
